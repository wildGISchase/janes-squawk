  +'<h2>A (Virtual) Bird Walk Through Queens</h2>'
  +'<p><em><small>Posted May 5, 2023</small></em></p>'+
  '<p>Welcome to our Jane\'s Walk! So glad you\'re joining us! We\'re two Queens residents who were curious to learn about the hundreds of birds that visit our borough every year, and which ones New Yorkers can expect this spring.</p>' +
  '<p>As you might have guessed, we\'re not professional birders! Rather, we\'re researchers, mapmakers, and data analysts who wanted to use these skills to tell a story about the incredible birds in our borough. In addition to understanding the geography, science, and numbers behind birds in Queens, we\'ll lead you on a virtual walk of the West Pond Trail at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, one of the best places to spot birds in New York City.</p>' +

  '<h2>First, a little context.</h2>' +
  '<p>Over 400 bird species have been documented in New York City, more than half the species regularly found in North America. Of these, over 370 species have been documented in Queens, more than any other borough according to <a href="https://ebird.org/about" target="_blank">eBird</a>, an open-source database managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (and our primary data source).</p>' +
  '<p>Jane\'s Walk is one of the best weekends of the year to spot many of these birds. That\'s because the festival happens in the middle of the spring bird migration, which occurs from about March to June in New York City for most birds, with a peak in May for shorebirds and most songbirds.</p>';

let divChapter3 =
  '<p>Queens\' distinction as the <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/events-birding/birding-resources/birding-in-nyc/birding-in-queens" target="_blank">"birdiest borough"</a> is due in part to its location along the Atlantic Flyway, one of four major north-south routes that birds travel in North America during the spring and fall migrations.</p>' +
  '<img src="assets/images/Atlantic-Flyway-Map-fwsgov.jpg" alt="Atlantic Flyway" width=100% /><p class="imageCredit">Source: U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service</p>' +
  '<p>The 3,000-mile route generally starts in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, then follows the Atlantic coast through Canada and the United States to the tropical areas of the Caribbean and South America.'

  '<p>Broadly, Queens boasts <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/nrg/documents/NRG_Publication_A_Guide_to_the_Birds_of_Queens.pdf" target="_blank">five types of bird habitats</a>: field, forest, freshwater, salt marsh, and seashore. From the eager chirping that ushers in the early morning to flocks that manuever in neat formation over buildings and bodies of water, birds are an ever-present neighbor.</p>' +
  '<p>Observation data submitted on eBird in 2021, the latest year for which data was available, reveals that the greatest diversity of bird sightings in the springtime are clustered near the borough\'s natural areas. (On the heatmap, the deeper the blue, the more species that people reported encountering in that location.)</p>';

  '<p>The growth of grasses and related plants on fertile land can lead to the formation of <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/our-work/conservation/habitat-protection/grasslands-and-capped-landfills" target="_blank">grasslands</a>. Although they are among the <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/learn/ecosystems/grasslands-in-new-york-city-parks" target="_blank">rarest</a> of habitats in New York City because of human development and invasive species, fields have been allowed to thrive on many underutilized sites to the great benefit of nesting and migrating birds. Fields require maintenance and limited pesticide use so that native species can grow and proliferate. And where fields meet other habitats, like forests, the fusion of plant species attracts numerous animals, including birds.</p>';

  '<p>Queens\' forest land consists of many species of trees of varying maturity. This enables a diversity of bird species to take shelter and sustenance in the tall tree canopies and undergrowth. <a href="https://nycaudubon.org/events-birding/birding-resources/birding-in-nyc/birding-in-queens/forest-park?&_ga=2.64092527.1737851004.1681271488-1871949272.1681271488#water-hole" target="_blank">Forest Park</a>, pictured here, is located on the site of an ancient glacier. The depressions the glacier left on the land resulted in present-day ponds, gullies, and one particularly popular “Water Hole” that draws migrating songbirds. To protect these critical breeding grounds and stopover locations for migrating birds, <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/our-work/conservation/habitat-protection/forests-and-upland-parks">forest conservation</a> is a necessity.</p>';

Flushing Meadows-Corona Park\'s <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park/highlights/11312" target="_blank">Willow Lake</a>, pictured here, and the surrounding marshes and meadows attract waterfowl, hawks, and other animals. Like other habitats, freshwater wetlands are home to native plant species that provide key habitat along the Atlantic flyway. Today, just <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/learn/ecosystems/wetlands-in-new-york-city-parks" target="_blank">one percent</a> of the city\'s historical wetlands remain, a sobering statistic given their important role in ecosystems and stormwater flood mitigation.</p>';

  '<p>Vegetation in salt marshes is hardy and has acclimated to both freshwater and saltwater. One particular species of grass, <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/udalls-park-preserve/highlights/11328" target="_blank">saltmarsh cordgrass</a>, thrives in sediment-rich deposits along the shore and provides the added benefit of acting as a natural filtration system for debris, producing mud that adds biodiversity. Like fields, many of which were once salt marshes themselves, they are also at the edges of other habitats. Wetlands in New York City have to contend not only with pollution and stormwater runoff, but also <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/our-work/conservation/habitat-protection/coastal-wetlands-and-beaches" target="_blank">impermeable development</a> that continues to be built atop sensitive watersheds.</p>';

  '<p>The Rockaway Penninsula is a hotspot for migratory birds in spring and autumn. Unfortunately, certain species of birds that nest along its beaches are threatened by encroaching human activity.

  '<p>With all this in mind, we set out for the West Pond Trail of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge on May 1st to see if we could observe birds from our research. The approximately two-mile trail is located in Broad Channel, an inhabited island in the middle of Jamaica Bay.</p>' +
  '<p>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a spectacular oasis comprised of 9,000 acres (20 square miles) of open bay, saltmarsh, mudflats, upland fields and woodland, small freshwater ponds, and two brackish man-made impoundments. Part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, the Refuge is the U.S. Department of the Interior\'s only wildlife refuge administered by the National Park Service.</p>';

Of these, approximately 70 bird species nest regularly at the refuge. In spring, Jamaica Bay is visited by numerous shorebirds, waterfowl, wading birds, terns, flycatchers, cuckoos, warblers, and tanagers.</p>' + 
  '<p>Created in 1953 by the Parks Department to improve habitat diversity in Jamaica Bay, the brackish, 45-acre West Pond is known to be especially good for viewing migratory shorebirds in breeding plumage, including the black bellied and semipalmated plovers, red knot, and short-billed dowitcher.</p>';
